# **Straw-Hat-Builds**

In the vast ocean of software development, we are all explorers, seeking the ultimate treasure: knowledge. Straw-Hat-Builds is a journeyâ€”a path to mastery in blockchain, Rust, and other realms of modern technology. Built with Leptos and leveraging the power of client-side rendering, this platform is a humble step toward empowering developers to build, learn, and grow.

## **Introduction**

Straw-Hat-Builds is more than just a repository; it's an adventure. Drawing inspiration from the unyielding spirit of the Straw Hat Pirates, this project is designed to help you navigate the complex seas of modern development. Whether you're diving into blockchain or exploring the intricacies of Rust, Straw-Hat-Builds is your ship.

## **Features**
- **Leptos Client-Side Rendering:** Fast and efficient rendering for modern web applications.
- **Modular Project Guides:** Each project is a map, guiding you through uncharted territories of development.
- **Focus on Blockchain and Rust:** Start your journey in these cutting-edge fields, with plans to expand into other areas.
- **Community-Driven Contributions:** Join a crew of like-minded explorers, contributing to the shared knowledge.

## **Getting Started**

Before you embark on this journey, ensure you have the necessary tools on board.

### **Prerequisites**
- **Rust:** Make sure Rust is installed on your system. If not, you can install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Trunk:** Leptos is the core framework used for this project, and it uses trunk to run Leptos CSR sites. Install it using Cargo:
  ```bash
  cargo install trunk
  ```
- **wasm32-unknown-unknown:** wasm32-unknown-unknown is a compilation target which allows us to run the application in the browser

### **Installation**

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juan-LukeKlopper/straw-hat-builds.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd straw-hat-builds
```
Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
cargo install
```

### **Running the Project**

To set sail and run the project locally:
```bash
trunk serve
```
Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to explore the project.

### **Building for Production**

When you're ready to deploy your project, you can build it for production:
```bash
trunk build --release
```
The production-ready files will be located in the `dist` directory.
