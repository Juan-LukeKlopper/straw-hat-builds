Ahoy, pirate! 🏴‍☠️  
We're about to dive deep into the secretive world of **Secret Network**, where privacy is the real treasure. As we sail through this project, you’ll get hands-on experience with the most powerful part of Secret Network: **private smart contracts**. This is where the magic happens, and we’ll be building right on top of it.

Don’t worry, we’ll cover some key things like how Secret Network is secure, fast, and keeps your data safe—but we won’t drown in theory. My goal? Keep you focused on the adventure of **building**. The blockchain rabbit hole is deep, and you could easily get lost in endless YouTube videos and blogs. My advice? *Finish this project first.* You'll be a much stronger navigator of the seas (and the blockchain) once you’ve actually launched your own creation!

I promise, all your research will make a lot more sense once you’ve built and deployed your first secret smart contract. 🔐


### What you need to know 🗝️
Secret Network is like your own treasure chest on the blockchain, but with **privacy** as the prize. Most blockchains are open books—everyone can see all transactions and data. Not here. Secret Network lets you keep your sensitive data encrypted, while still harnessing the power of blockchain.

Here’s the TL;DR of Secret Network:
- **Proof-of-stake** blockchain (no crazy energy consumption here!)
- **Private smart contracts**: Execute contracts while keeping inputs, outputs, and state encrypted.
- **Gas fees**: You can pay in SCRT (Secret's native token).
- **Transaction time**: ~5-6 seconds (fast enough to sail through the blockchain seas).
- **Average transaction cost**: Under $0.10.
- Secret contracts allow you to build privacy-first applications, from private DeFi to encrypted NFTs. Think of it as building treasure maps that only those with the right key can unlock.


### 🏛 Architecture of Secret Network
Secret Network is built on **CosmWasm**, the same smart contract platform as Terra, Cosmos, and others. This means everything you learn about **CosmWasm smart contracts** here will apply to other chains too, but with one big difference: on **Secret Network**, contracts can keep their data private.

Like the Straw Hat crew’s secret hideouts, Secret Network has encrypted smart contracts where only the right people can see what’s inside. It’s also part of the Cosmos ecosystem, so you can move assets between blockchains using **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**. 🌍

Here's a map of the connected blockchain universe that Secret Network is part of. You can think of it as the Grand Line of the crypto world!

### 📑 Smart contracts on Secret Network
A **smart contract** is just a piece of code that lives on the blockchain and runs when certain conditions are met. But in Secret Network, this code can handle sensitive information—think passwords, financial data, or even your pirate treasure chest’s location—without revealing it to everyone.

While on most blockchains, smart contracts are like writing your secrets in the sand for everyone to see, **Secret contracts** keep those secrets locked up, only revealing them to the right people. 🚪🔐


### 💬 Messaging with CosmWasm on Secret Network
When you interact with smart contracts on Secret Network, you do so by sending **messages**. Just like passing notes around the crew on the Thousand Sunny, you’ll be sending these messages to the contract to make things happen.

Here’s the three messages you’ll use to get things done:
- **`instantiate()`**: This is like setting up the contract—it gets the initial state in place.
- **`execute()`**: This is how you interact with the contract—when you want to make something happen, like sending treasure from one account to another.
- **`query()`**: Want to check on some info in the contract? This is your spyglass—it lets you take a look without changing anything.

That’s about all the theory we need for now! If it’s still a bit fuzzy, don’t worry. Once we start coding and seeing the contracts in action, everything will fall into place.


Get ready, pirate! You’re about to unlock the secrets of **Secret Network** and build something truly private on the blockchain. 🌊🏴‍☠️ Let's hoist the sails and start coding!
